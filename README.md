# Multiprocess_Performance
Research on how an algorithm's performance degrades as number of concurrent processes increase in an multi-process environement
```bash
sudo ./mm_parallel_instance.sh
```
## To know why there is a progress imbalance while running multiple concurrent processes: cache-imbalance is the culprit
```bash
sudo ./mm_parallel_instance_cache_imbalance.sh
```
